## 2026-05-09 — DevKit: per-panel crash boundaries + MissionControl initial-render guard

### Files changed
- `src/pages/DevToolsPage.tsx` — added `DevKitPanelBoundary` import; `renderPanel()` now wraps every panel case in `<DevKitPanelBoundary panelName="…">` via a local `wrap()` helper; a single panel crash no longer takes down the whole DevKit shell — the sidebar, header, and all other tabs stay live; the boundary shows the error name, stack trace, component stack, timestamp, and a "Copy full error" button so crashes can be reported precisely.
- `src/components/dev-kit/MissionControlPanel.tsx` — initial-render guard changed from `!data && loading` to `!data && (loading || !error)` — the skeleton now shows on the very first render tick (before the `useEffect` fires and sets `loading: true`) so the full UI never renders with `data === null`.

### Bug fixed
Production error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data')` was crashing one or more DevKit panels and propagating to the global error boundary, which made it look like the whole `/devkit` route was down. Root cause: no `DevKitPanelBoundary` was scoped to individual panels in `renderPanel()`, so any panel-level throw reached React's root. The boundary is now applied to all 20 panels.

## 2026-05-09 — DevKit: all hidden panels wired + Cmd+K palette + session context

### Files changed
- `src/pages/DevToolsPage.tsx` — full rewrite: wrapped in `DevKitSessionProvider`; replaced local `isAuthenticated` state with `useDevKitSession()` `isUnlocked`; password and passkey login both call `unlock()` so all panels receive a live session token; auto-unlock from remembered session via `loadRememberedToken()`; sidebar reorganised into 7 labelled groups; all 20 panels imported and rendered; Cmd+K command palette (⌘K / Ctrl+K) with live search; session lock countdown warning; mobile "More" sheet shows all panels in a grid grouped by category; `MissionControlPanel` receives correct `onNavigate` handler with tab-to-id map; panel count badge in sidebar footer.
- `src/components/dev-kit/AITestSlotModelsCard.tsx` — new component; reads per-slot AI test model config via `fetchAITestSlotModels()` helper; displays OpenRouter / Groq / DeepSeek slot models with override-vs-default label; "Manage in AI Radar" button deep-links to ai panel via `onNavigateToKeys` prop; handles loading / error / refresh states.

### Previously hidden panels now connected (12 total)
`AnalyticsPanel`, `VisitorsPanel`, `LiveActivityPanel`, `MissionControlPanel`, `ObservabilityPanel`, `EmailManagementPanel`, `EmailAutomationsPanel`, `FeatureFlagsPanel`, `ModerationPanel`, `OnboardingFunnelPanel`, `PortfolioUsernamesPanel`, `DevKitRunner`.

### Root cause of panels being hidden
`DevKitSessionProvider` was never mounted anywhere in the app. Panels that call `useDevKitSession()` would have thrown "must be used within DevKitSessionProvider" at runtime. Now the provider wraps the entire DevTools shell.
