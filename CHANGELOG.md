# Changelog

## 2026-04-18 — Resume Builder UX Improvements (Task #9)

### New Features
- **Template-first intake**: "Start from Scratch" in the Create Resume dialog now includes a template selection step (between experience level and title), showing 8 popular templates with live thumbnails so users choose a visual style before typing a single word. The selected template is written directly to the new resume row — the editor opens already wearing it.
- **Certifications & Languages always visible**: These two sections now appear in the editor stepper for every resume, regardless of whether they contain data. Previously they only surfaced when data was present. Awards, Projects, and other optional sections still auto-promote on data.

### Already Implemented (confirmed during audit)
- Template thumbnails in the template picker (TemplateThumbnail component) — was already live
- Persistent autosave indicator (ProgressChip cloud icons) — was already live
- Partial PDF parse recovery (ImportReviewSheet shows parsed fields with "Not detected" badges and lets users proceed) — was already live
- "Add sections" label on mobile stepper — was already live

## 2026-04-15 — WiseHire Edge Function Deployment & Bug Fixes (Task #12)

### Bug Fixes (pre-deploy)
- **wisehire-write-jd**: Fixed `WISEHIRE_STARTER_PLAN` undefined reference → replaced with inline string `'wisehire_starter'`
- **wisehire-bulk-screen**: Fixed `checkRateLimit` called with positional args → corrected to `(userId, { actionType, maxRequests, windowSeconds })` object signature; fixed `aiResponse.choices[0].message.content` → `aiResponse.content`; fixed `authErrorResponse(err, req)` → `authErrorResponse(err, origin)`
- **wisehire-send-outreach**: Replaced `import { corsHeaders }` (non-existent named export) → `getCorsHeaders(origin)`; replaced `getAuthUser` (non-existent) → `requireAuth`; fixed `checkRateLimit` signature; switched to `getServiceClient()` for DB client
- **wisehire-talent-search**: Same cors/auth/rateLimit fixes as send-outreach
- **wisehire-talent-view**: Same cors/auth fixes; improved view-count increment (uses fetched `view_count` from initial query instead of undefined variable)
- **wisehire-apply**: Replaced `import { corsHeaders }` → `getCorsHeaders(origin)`; replaced `getAuthUser` → `requireAuth`; switched to `Deno.serve` (replacing deprecated `serve` import); switched to `getServiceClient()` for DB client

### Deployment
- Deployed all 93 edge functions to Supabase project `jnsfmkzgxsviuthaqlyy` via `bash scripts/deploy-functions.sh`
- Redeployed `wisehire-waitlist-join` and `wisehire-validate-early-access` with `--no-verify-jwt` flag (public endpoints — bot-guarded internally)
- Disabled JWT verification via Supabase management API for both public endpoints

### Additional Bug Fixes (post-deploy, owner_id FK mismatch)
- **wisehire-send-outreach**: Fixed `owner_id = userId` (auth UUID) → `owner_id = profileId` (profiles PK); all three `wisehire_candidates`, `wisehire_companies`, and `wisehire_outreach_emails` queries now use the correct FK value via a pre-query `SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE user_id = $userId`
- **wisehire-talent-view**: Same profileId fix for `wisehire_companies` query
- **wisehire-bulk-screen**: Same profileId fix for `wisehire_bulk_screen_jobs` insert
- **wisehire-generate-brief**: Same profileId fix for `wisehire_candidates` query and `wisehire_candidate_briefs` insert
- **wisehire-mask-cvs**: Fixed subscription plan query — updated column names `plan_id`→`plan_name`, `trial_ends_at`→`trial_expires_at`; added `trial_plan` support so trial HR accounts pass the plan gate

## 2026-04-15 — Wise AI Phases 2 & 3

### Phase 2: New AI Tools
- Added `get_company_briefing` tool to agentic-chat edge function: AI can now research a company and open the Company Briefing sheet from conversation
- Added `open_job_tracker` tool to agentic-chat edge function: AI can redirect the user to the Applications tracker (/applications)
- SYSTEM_PROMPT updated to describe both new tools with usage guidance

### Phase 2: "Add with AI" in Experience Editor
- Added Bot-icon button to `ExperienceSection` for each experience entry; clicking sends a pre-filled message to the Wise AI chat
- `chatTriggerStore` (Zustand) created at `src/store/chatTriggerStore.ts`; deep components write, EditorPage reads and opens AI chat sheet automatically
- `EditorPage` now watches `pendingPrompt` from the trigger store and forwards it as `chatInitialMessage` to `AgenticChatSheet`

### Phase 2: Frontend Tool Handlers
- `useAgenticChat` exports `pendingAction` / `clearPendingAction`; handles `get_company_briefing` (sets pending action) and `open_job_tracker` (navigates to /applications)
- `AgenticChatSheet` handles `get_company_briefing` tool call: checks cache, shows inline "View Saved / Generate Fresh" decision card, then opens `CompanyBriefingSheet`
- `CompanyBriefingSheet` accepts `initialCompanyName`, `initialBriefing`, and `onBriefingGenerated` props; auto-generates when company name provided without cached data

### Phase 3: Tool Output Caching
- New Supabase migration: `tool_cache` table with `(user_id, tool_name, cache_key, output JSONB, created_at, expires_at)`; unique index for upsert; 7-day TTL for `get_company_briefing`
- `useToolCache` hook at `src/hooks/useToolCache.ts`: `getCache`, `setCache`, `deleteCache`, `getCacheAge` — all RLS-safe, only active for authenticated users; normalised cache keys
- `AgenticChatSheet` writes to cache via `onBriefingGenerated` callback; reads cache before opening briefing sheet; inline UI shows cache age and offers "View Saved / Generate Fresh" choice
