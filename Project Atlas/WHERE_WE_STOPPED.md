## 2. Latest Important Commits

* **`ab4054f3`** — `design(email): refresh localized transactional templates`
* **`ea713958`** — `feat(devkit): route admin password reset via internal HMAC signed service requests`
* **`c4bc9fea`** — `fix(devkit): validate delegated admin auth response`
* **`b7e43412`** — `fix(devkit): use lightweight delegated email auth`
* **`18d6263a`** — `fix(devkit): accept signed admin tokens in email service`
* **`6a38a20e`** — `chore(devkit): fix admin operations and impersonation storage`

## 3. Where We Stopped & Current Active Focus

* **Current Active Focus**: DevKit Admin Password Reset Link flow implemented locally and synced with latest redesigned transactional email system from `main`. Verified with Vitest tests, TypeScript compiler, Node syntax checks, and Vite production build.
* **Current State**: Implemented direct secure password reset link flow (`https://wiseresume.app/auth/reset-password?email=...&challengeToken=...`) integrated with redesigned dark canvas transactional email templates (`emailShell`). Admin requests route `UserDetailDrawer` / `EmailManagementPanel` -> `admin-devkit-data` (`send-admin-password-reset-link`) -> internal HMAC request -> `email-service` (`internal-send-admin-password-reset-link`). High-entropy challenge tokens (32 bytes) are hashed at rest (`challenge_token_hash`). Legacy reset path in `admin-email` is deprecated and throws explicit error.
* **Last Completed Task**: Synced branch with `origin/main`, resolved email template conflicts, completed full validation suite (`npx tsc --noEmit` passed, `npm run build` passed, source hashes regenerated). Appwrite deployment NOT performed (pending owner authorization). Targeted deploy list: `admin-devkit-data,email-service,admin-email`.

---

## 4. Next Recommended Tasks

1. **Monitor Production Email Traffic**: Monitor real user email verification and password reset traffic after production deployment.
2. **AI Gateway Production Verification**: Verify Appwrite `ai-gateway` serverless function execution and response handling in production (`wiseresume.app`).
3. **DevKit Visitor Analytics Monitoring**: Audit Cairo-day boundary aggregation in `admin-visitor-analytics`.

---

## 5. Blocked / Pending Owner Verification

* **Public Portfolio Contact Form (Turnstile Captcha)**: Blocked in automated E2E browser environments because Cloudflare Turnstile rejects headless automation contexts. Verified working via manual owner submission in production.
* **Billing / Payments Activation**: Blocked on explicit project owner business decision.

## 6. Do-Not-Reopen Constraints

> [!CAUTION]
> Every developer and AI agent MUST respect these immutable project constraints:
>
> 1. **Do NOT restore Supabase or Kinde**: WiseResume is Appwrite-native. Supabase and Kinde have been completely removed.
> 2. **Do NOT treat Hostinger or `resume.thewise.cloud` as current deployment truth**: Production hosting is Vercel (`wiseresume.app`).
> 3. **Do NOT re-enable billing without explicit owner decision**: Billing is intentionally disabled / Coming Soon.
> 4. **Do NOT treat `Project Atlas/archive/` as current truth**: Archive files are historical-only and non-canonical.
> 5. **Do NOT perform target-all function deploys (`target=all`)**: Always specify targeted function directories (e.g. `--only=ai-gateway`).
> 6. **Do NOT perform unapproved Appwrite or Vercel deployments**: Deployments require explicit owner authorization.
