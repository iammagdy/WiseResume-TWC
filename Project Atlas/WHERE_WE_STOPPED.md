## 3. Where We Stopped & Current Active Focus

* **Current Active Focus**: DevKit/Admin Users deployment completed; admin password-reset DevKit authentication remains blocked.
* **Current State**: Official workflow run `28687088873` deployed `admin-devkit-data,admin-impersonate,email-service`. The impersonation schema, deployed hashes, and Act As issue/verify/revoke lifecycle passed live checks. `email-service` still returns HTTP 401 for a valid DevKit token before code generation, so reset delivery and success-audit verification remain incomplete.
* **Last Completed Task**: Completed targeted deployment and live verification through Appwrite APIs. Confirmed no OTP, token, email body, bearer secret, or Resend payload exposure. Stopped after three narrow authentication fixes failed to clear the email-service boundary.

---

## 4. Next Recommended Tasks

1. **Admin Reset Authentication Design**: Decide on one authoritative cross-function admin-token verification contract for `email-service`; do not add another fallback patch without reviewing the signing-key and Appwrite execution boundary.
2. **Remaining Post-Deployment QA**: After that decision, verify one reset-code delivery, its success audit, audit-failure warning behavior, and authenticated collision-control visibility.
3. **AI Gateway Production Verification**: Verify Appwrite `ai-gateway` serverless function execution and response handling in production (`wiseresume.app`).
4. **DevKit Visitor Analytics Monitoring**: Audit Cairo-day boundary aggregation in `admin-visitor-analytics`.

---

## 5. Blocked / Pending Owner Verification

* **Public Portfolio Contact Form (Turnstile Captcha)**: Blocked in automated E2E browser environments because Cloudflare Turnstile rejects headless automation contexts. Verified working via manual owner submission in production.
* **Billing / Payments Activation**: Blocked on explicit project owner business decision.
* **Admin Password Reset Code**: Blocked because deployed `email-service` rejects the valid DevKit token with HTTP 401. No email was sent and no success audit was created during verification.

## 6. Do-Not-Reopen Constraints

> [!CAUTION]
> Every developer and AI agent MUST respect these immutable project constraints:
>
> 1. **Do NOT restore Supabase or Kinde**: WiseResume is Appwrite-native. Supabase and Kinde have been completely removed.
> 2. **Do NOT treat Hostinger or `resume.thewise.cloud` as current deployment truth**: Production hosting is Vercel (`wiseresume.app`).
> 3. **Do NOT re-enable billing without explicit owner decision**: Billing is intentionally disabled / Coming Soon.
> 4. **Do NOT treat `Project Atlas/archive/` as current truth**: Archive files are historical-only and non-canonical.
> 5. **Do NOT perform target-all function deploys (`target=all`)**: Always specify targeted function directories (e.g. `--only=ai-gateway`).
> 6. **Do NOT perform unapproved Appwrite or Vercel deployments**: Deployments require explicit owner authorization.
