## 2. Current Stack and Architecture

* **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript 5, Vite 6, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, shadcn/ui, TanStack Query, and Zustand.
* **Frontend hosting:** Vercel. The latest verified code-bearing production deployment is `dpl_BC5DxdhG1wEJR1m3TBuxhf9ZDfjm` for commit `a14b306da29e4ac7a1db16e85fcc54c790c3727c`; environment URL `https://wise-resume-duk55phaa-iam-magdy.vercel.app`.
* **Backend:** Appwrite Cloud Databases, Storage, and Serverless Functions.
* **Authentication:** Appwrite Auth exclusively.
* **AI:** Most product AI features route through the server-side `ai-gateway`. The explicitly documented standalone exceptions are `resume-section-ai` and `job-import`; browser code must never call provider APIs directly.
* **AI routing:** Current Tailoring production evidence used DeepSeek `deepseek-chat`. Provider pools and fallback rules are defined server-side; do not infer one universal order for every feature.
* **Payments/billing:** Disabled / Coming Soon.
* **WiseHire:** Secondary and deprioritized.
* **Owner-scoped collections:** `user_preferences`, `jobs`, and `job_applications` use document security, collection-level user create permission, and owner-only document read/update/delete permissions.
* **Realtime CSP:** The active frontend CSP allows `wss://fra.cloud.appwrite.io`.
* **Visitor country:** Browser tracking does not call GeoJS. Server-side enrichment may use Appwrite request metadata; unknown country is acceptable.

## 3. Current Product Status

* **Critical functionality smoke sequence:** `CLOSED`; follow-up export, owner-permission, Realtime, GeoJS, Premium Cover Letter, and Tailoring content-integrity work is documented and closed.
* **Performance Phase 1:** Closed with the authenticated Broadcast `active` schema warning.
* **Performance Phase 2:** Editor startup closed with a retained cold-run warning.
* **Performance Phase 3:** Closed for approved scope, but Public Portfolio cold-mobile LCP remains `5.860 s` median against the `<4.0 s` target.
* **Performance Phase 4 timing/recovery:** Bounded provider timing, async execution, result-only recovery, duplicate prevention, idempotency, and exactly-once charging are production verified.
* **Tailoring current status:** `VERIFIED_READY`. Project identity, chronology, current state, and URLs are now preserved at both gateway and frontend merge boundaries. One controlled production action created child resume `6a62910a0013a37009a3`, retained both source projects and their exact metadata, materially rewrote both descriptions, charged exactly two credits, and survived refresh, direct reopen, and export-preview rendering.
* **Premium Cover Letter:** Generation, save, update, durable persistence, owner permissions, and one two-credit charge are proven. The exact original browser refresh/reopen trace was not retained.
* **Performance sequence:** `CLOSED_WITH_PORTFOLIO_LCP_WARNING`; the remaining known performance warning is Public Portfolio cold-mobile LCP.

## 4. Deployment State

* **Frontend code:** Commit `a14b306da29e4ac7a1db16e85fcc54c790c3727c` is the latest verified code-bearing Vercel deployment (`dpl_BC5DxdhG1wEJR1m3TBuxhf9ZDfjm`, `READY`).
* **Appwrite target:** `ai-gateway` only.
* **Workflow:** `.github/workflows/deploy-appwrite-hubs.yml`, run `30048216417`.
* **Active deployment:** `6a628eafd09be552df71`, status `ready`, runtime timeout `180 s`.
* **Source hash:** `6a61da4d2b3efa73449ca7e3f77ebb6797d35dd005ff8f01f81644439bd72d12`.
* **Parity:** Deployed `ai-gateway` source matches the repository implementation.

## 5. Operational Rules

1. Pushes to `main` may trigger Vercel through Git integration. Do not change Vercel settings or environment variables without explicit authorization.
2. Appwrite functions deploy through `.github/workflows/deploy-appwrite-hubs.yml` or `scripts/deploy_hubs.cjs`.
3. Never use `target=all`; deploy only explicitly approved function targets.
4. Production is Vercel plus Appwrite. Hostinger deployment material is historical unless the owner explicitly assigns a separate legacy-domain task.
5. Do not replace Appwrite Auth/backend architecture, reactivate billing, change AI routing/models/credits, or alter schemas/permissions without a scoped owner-approved task.
